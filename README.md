Breast Cancer Classification

In this project, I intend to apply Deep Learning techniques on a multi-class classification task which identifies the cancer type based on the images obtained for analysis. The dataset used for our project is the BreakHis dataset which is a breast cancer histopathology image database. It contains around 9,100 microscopic images of different types of breast cancer tissues. Classification of breast cancer images can help doctors to give more detailed treatment for saving peopleâ€™s lives in the world and reduce death rates of breast cancer. These influences not only improve scientific techniques in tumor recognition area but also bring social benefits to everyone.  

Several studies have reported how to make multi-class classification on breast cancer images with same magnifying factor by using online augmented data. However, research into balanced augmented images with multiple magnifying factors which saved on disk remains to be accomplished. Here I plan to implement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize breast cancer images. CNN is a deep learning technique that is used to extract features from the images automatically. I also plan to use pretrained model Inception ResNet V2 in classifying cancer images using transfer learning techniques. 

I have implemented the models on threee different types of dataset:
1. Raw image data
2. Online augmented data
3. Saved balanced augmented data
